CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter the numerator: "))

    while denominator == 0:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")

    fraction = numerator / denominator
    print(fraction)
except ValueError:
    print("Numerator and denominator must be valid numbers!")
print("Finished.")

# Question 1
# ValueError will occur when the numerator or denominator is a float and not a integer

# Question 2
# ZeroDivisionError will occur when the denominator is zero because you cant divide by zero

# Question 3
# Yes to avoid Zero DivisionError you use a while loop for denominator = 0
