# Practical 07

## About The Repository

The repository includes the practical exercises in CP1404 Programming 2 subject.

## About the Author

The repository was created by Lachlan Webb, a student of CP1404. I enjoy learning how to write clean code
as well as the different ways to write code.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** ensures that each class or function has one reason to change, making 
  code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.
- **Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Applying the DRY principle helps keep code concise, reduces redundancy, and makes
  it easier to update and refactor.
- **Code Readability:** Code readability makes it easy for readers to understand. This involves using meaningful names for variables and functions and writing clear comments where necessary,
